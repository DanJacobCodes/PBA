<h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm Dan Jacob, I'm an aspiring Web Developer and UX/UI Designer! My journey to programming has been anything but linear, from pursuing a degree in Business to dropping it all to join a programming boot camp in Seattle, called Epicodus! I was inspired to make the change to development afer taking an Intro to C++ Programming class in college - as someone who has followed the tech industry closely, I decided I wanted to get my hands dirty. Over the course of a year, I've worked in pairs, groups, and individually to build dynamic web applications using a variety of languages and frameworks within agile working environments.</p>

        <p>Building upon my exisiting skill set is imperative to my growth as a developer. I've thoroughly enjoyed working in frameworks such as Angular and Rails, but it is a priority to me to become more well rounded. Through programming with web technologies, I've come to understand concepts that have been used for many years. Althought I may not have a traditional CS background, I've made sure to understand computing as a science. With tech being such a broad and layered field it can be pretty overwhelming to pick exactly what to do. I love the designing aspect of development, but I also love trying to tackle technical problems. I hope to be in a role that allows me to work with developers and engineers, but also designers to build applications that are useful, engaging, technically sound, and exceptionally good to look at. Ultimately, I believe the purpose of technology is to make our lives easier. Please feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to talk!
